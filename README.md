# Datasets for FastEnsemble paper

This repository contains the datasets and scripts used in the following paper:

Y. Tabatabaee, E. Wedell, M. Park, T. Warnow (2025). *FastEnsemble: Scalable ensemble clustering on large networks*. PLOS Complex Systems 2(10): e0000069 [preliminary version appeared at International Conference on Complex Networks and their Applications (CNA) 2024] DOI: [10.1371/journal.pcsy.0000069](https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcsy.0000069)

For experiments in this study, we generated a collection of artifical networks such as ring of cliques, Erdos-Renyi (ER) graphs, and combinations of ER graphs with LFR graphs and ring of cliques. All these datasets were generated using [NetworkX](https://networkx.org). Additionally, we used a collection of 27 synthetic LFR graphs from [Park et. al. (2024)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-53499-7_1), that were generated based on the properties of a collection of real networks and their Leiden clusterings with different resolutions. These datasets are available at [Illinois Data Bank](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-6271968). 

This repository includes the new datasets generated for this study, as well as the output of different clustering methods in each experiment.
